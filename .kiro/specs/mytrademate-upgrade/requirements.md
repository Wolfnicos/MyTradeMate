# MyTradeMate iOS App Upgrade Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive upgrade of the MyTradeMate iOS SwiftUI trading application. The upgrade addresses critical compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, stability risks, and missing functionality while modernizing the codebase to iOS 17+ standards and Swift 5.9+.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Swift & iOS Compatibility Upgrade

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to use modern Swift and iOS versions so that it remains compatible with current development tools and can leverage the latest platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL use Swift 5.9 or later
2. WHEN the app runs THEN it SHALL support iOS 17.0 as the minimum deployment target
3. WHEN using SwiftUI features THEN the app SHALL use modern navigation APIs (NavigationStack, NavigationPath)
4. WHEN building for release THEN the project SHALL compile without warnings on Xcode 15+

### Requirement 2: Security & Keychain Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API keys and sensitive data to be stored securely so that my trading accounts remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API keys THEN the app SHALL use only KeychainStore (not deprecated ExchangeKeychainManager)
2. WHEN making network requests THEN all connections SHALL use HTTPS with proper ATS configuration
3. WHEN handling credentials THEN no sensitive data SHALL be logged or exposed in debug output
4. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL verify keychain integrity and handle corruption gracefully

### Requirement 3: Stability & Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and never crash unexpectedly so that my trading experience is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering force unwraps THEN the code SHALL use safe binding or guard statements instead
2. WHEN CoreML prediction fails THEN the app SHALL fallback to demo mode or cached predictions
3. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the app SHALL implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN trade execution fails THEN the app SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN the app SHALL handle low memory warnings appropriately

### Requirement 4: Info.plist Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app's Info.plist to use modern iOS configuration so that it passes App Store review and supports current devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specifying device capabilities THEN the app SHALL require arm64 only (remove armv7)
2. WHEN configuring iOS requirements THEN LSRequiresIPhoneOS SHALL be properly configured for universal apps
3. WHEN defining supported orientations THEN the configuration SHALL support modern iPhone form factors
4. WHEN setting bundle version THEN it SHALL follow semantic versioning

### Requirement 5: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes and ensure app reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing core trading logic THEN unit tests SHALL cover order execution, risk management, and position tracking
2. WHEN testing API key management THEN unit tests SHALL verify KeychainStore operations
3. WHEN testing CoreML predictions THEN unit tests SHALL cover model loading, feature preparation, and prediction handling
4. WHEN testing WebSocket connections THEN integration tests SHALL verify reconnection logic in demo mode
5. WHEN running tests THEN all tests SHALL pass on iOS 17+ simulator

### Requirement 6: Strategy System Implementation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want access to multiple trading strategies so that I can choose the approach that best fits my trading style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing strategies THEN the app SHALL provide at least 3 working strategies: RSI, MACD, and EMA Crossover
2. WHEN selecting a strategy THEN the app SHALL allow parameter customization
3. WHEN a strategy generates signals THEN they SHALL be displayed with confidence levels and reasoning
4. WHEN switching strategies THEN the change SHALL take effect immediately in demo mode
5. WHEN strategies are active THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing signal display system

### Requirement 7: Settings Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all app settings to be properly integrated and persistent so that my preferences are maintained across app launches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changing settings THEN they SHALL be immediately reflected throughout the app
2. WHEN toggling demo/paper/live modes THEN the appropriate safety checks SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN enabling dark mode THEN the theme SHALL persist across app restarts
4. WHEN adjusting trading parameters THEN they SHALL be validated for safety
5. WHEN settings are corrupted THEN the app SHALL reset to safe defaults

### Requirement 8: Chart Rendering Enhancement

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see proper candlestick charts so that I can analyze price action and make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN candlestick charts SHALL display OHLC data correctly
2. WHEN changing timeframes THEN charts SHALL update with appropriate data
3. WHEN charts load THEN they SHALL show loading states and handle empty data gracefully
4. WHEN interacting with charts THEN basic zoom and pan functionality SHALL be available
5. WHEN charts display data THEN volume information SHALL be included

### Requirement 9: iOS 17 Widget Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see key trading metrics on my home screen so that I can monitor my positions without opening the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding widgets THEN an interactive widget SHALL be available for key metrics
2. WHEN viewing the widget THEN it SHALL display current P&L, open positions, and connection status
3. WHEN the widget is tapped THEN it SHALL deep link to the relevant app section
4. WHEN market data updates THEN the widget SHALL refresh appropriately
5. WHEN in demo mode THEN the widget SHALL clearly indicate demo status

### Requirement 10: Architecture Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code architecture so that the app can be easily extended and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ViewModels become large THEN they SHALL be refactored into focused, single-responsibility components
2. WHEN services are used THEN they SHALL be injected via dependency injection
3. WHEN organizing code THEN new files SHALL be placed in appropriate directories (Security/, Settings/, Strategies/, Themes/, Tests/)
4. WHEN implementing features THEN they SHALL follow established MVVM patterns
5. WHEN handling async operations THEN they SHALL use structured concurrency appropriately

### Requirement 11: Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent logging throughout the app so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor app behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging events THEN all components SHALL use the unified Log utility
2. WHEN in debug mode THEN detailed logs SHALL be available for troubleshooting
3. WHEN in production THEN sensitive information SHALL never be logged
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN relevant metrics SHALL be logged for analysis
