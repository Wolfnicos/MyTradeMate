# MyTradeMate v1.0.0-rc2 Verification Audit

## 🎯 Pre-TestFlight Checklist

### ✅ Critical System Validations

#### 1. Strategy Engine Validation
- [ ] All 16 strategies return confidence ≥ 0.30
- [ ] Direct Fusion aggregation logs appear as: `🗳️ Individual Strategy Vote - [Strategy]: [BUY/SELL] @0.XX`
- [ ] No "ensemble" references in logs (should be "Direct Fusion")
- [ ] Strategy voting transparency logs show individual votes before aggregation

#### 2. Trading Pipeline (Demo + Paper)
- [ ] **Demo Mode**: Place buy order → See toast notification + PnL update
- [ ] **Paper Mode**: Place sell order → Confirm event pipeline triggers
- [ ] **Order Flow**: Market orders execute immediately, Limit orders show pending status
- [ ] **Telemetry**: `📊 Telemetry Event: trade_success` appears in console after trades

#### 3. Dashboard & UX
- [ ] **Large Chart**: Renders at ≥420px height with candlesticks + volume
- [ ] **Timeframe Pills**: Display exactly "1m", "5m", "15m", "1h", "4h", "1d" (not m1, m5, etc.)
- [ ] **Buy/Sell Bar**: Market/Limit toggle works, amount validation, confirmation flow
- [ ] **AI Decision Ribbon**: Shows last decision + confidence % + source (Strategies/4h Model)

#### 4. Timeframe Routing
- [ ] **1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d**: Routes to Strategies (logs: `[ROUTING] source=Strategies`)
- [ ] **4h**: Routes to 4h AI Model (logs: `[ROUTING] source=AI`)
- [ ] **Chart Switching**: No crashes when switching between all 6 timeframes
- [ ] **Data Loading**: Smooth transitions, no stuck loading states

#### 5. AI & Circuit Breaker
- [ ] **4h Timeframe**: AI predictions appear with confidence 0.55-0.95
- [ ] **AI Failure**: Falls back to strategies gracefully (logs: `⚡ Circuit breaker activated`)
- [ ] **Strategy Fallback**: Shows source as "4h Model (fallback)" when AI unavailable

#### 6. Terminology Standardization
- [ ] **UI Text**: All "Direct Fusion" (no "ensemble" anywhere)
- [ ] **Logs**: Strategy logs say "Direct Fusion" not "ensemble"
- [ ] **Settings**: Strategy screen shows "Direct Fusion" branding
- [ ] **Notifications**: Event names use Direct Fusion terminology

#### 7. Error Handling & Stability
- [ ] **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback to demo data with user notification
- [ ] **Memory Pressure**: App handles background/foreground without crashes
- [ ] **Invalid Input**: Amount validation prevents negative/zero trade amounts
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Empty chart data shows placeholder, not crash
