## Test Execution

To run the performance tests:

```bash
# Run unit performance tests
xcodebuild test -scheme MyTradeMate -only-testing:MyTradeMateTests/EmptyStateIllustrationsPerformanceTests

# Run integration performance tests  
xcodebuild test -scheme MyTradeMate -only-testing:MyTradeMateTests/EmptyStatePerformanceIntegrationTests

# Run validation tests
xcodebuild test -scheme MyTradeMate -only-testing:MyTradeMateTests/EmptyStatePerformanceValidation
```

## Performance Monitoring in Debug Builds

Add the performance debug view to your app for real-time monitoring:

```swift
#if DEBUG
EmptyStatePerformanceDebugView()
#endif
```

This provides real-time performance metrics and recommendations during development.
