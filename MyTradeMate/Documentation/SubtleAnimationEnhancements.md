- Background pulse: 3.0s cycle with 0.3s delay

## Performance Optimizations

### Animation Manager Enhancements

New animation helper methods have been added to `AnimationManager`:

```swift
// Subtle breathing animation for backgrounds
func subtleBreathingAnimation(duration: Double = 4.0) -> Animation

// Gentle floating animation for elements
func floatingAnimation(duration: Double = 3.0, delay: Double = 0) -> Animation

// Shimmer effect animation
func shimmerAnimation(duration: Double = 2.0, delay: Double = 0) -> Animation

// Gentle rotation animation
func gentleRotationAnimation(duration: Double = 8.0, delay: Double = 0) -> Animation
```

### Performance Features

1. **Device-Aware Timing**: Animation durations are optimized based on device capabilities
2. **Memory Pressure Handling**: Animations are disabled under memory pressure
3. **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects accessibility settings for reduced motion
4. **Low Power Mode**: Automatically reduces animation complexity
5. **Thermal State Monitoring**: Disables animations during critical thermal states

### Animation State Management

- **Proper Cleanup**: All animation states are reset when views disappear
- **Staggered Delays**: Prevents all animations from starting simultaneously
- **Conditional Enablement**: Animations only start if performance conditions are met

## Accessibility Compliance

### Reduced Motion Support

All animations respect the `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled` setting:
- Reduced animation durations (30-50% of normal)
- Simplified animation curves
- Elimination of complex multi-state animations

### VoiceOver Compatibility

- Animations don't interfere with VoiceOver navigation
- Proper accessibility labels maintained during animations
- Animation states don't affect accessibility element ordering

## Dark Mode Optimization

### Color Adaptations

All animations work seamlessly in both light and dark modes:
- Dynamic opacity adjustments for better contrast
- Color-scheme-aware glow effects
- Proper contrast ratios maintained during animations

### Visual Consistency

- Animation intensities adjusted for dark mode visibility
- Glow effects optimized for different backgrounds
- Shimmer effects adapted for contrast

## Implementation Details

### Animation Architecture

```swift
// Multiple animation states per illustration
@State private var animateChart = false
@State private var animateBackground = false
@State private var animateGlow = false

// Performance-optimized timing
.animation(
    .easeInOut(duration: ImageOptimizer.shared.optimalAnimationDuration(3.0))
    .repeatForever(autoreverses: true)
    .delay(Double(index) * 0.2),
    value: animateChart
)
```

### Sine Wave Variations

Natural-feeling animations using mathematical functions:
```swift
.scaleEffect(animateChart ? 1.0 + sin(Double(index) * 0.5) * 0.1 : 0.9)
.offset(y: animateCoins ? sin(Double(index) * 1.2) * 3 : offsetMultiplier/2)
```

### Conditional Animation Enablement

```swift
.onAppear {
    if ImageOptimizer.shared.shouldEnableAnimations {
        withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.5)) {
            animateChart = true
        }
        // Additional animations with delays...
    }
}
```
